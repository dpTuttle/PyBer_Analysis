# PyBer Analysis

Analyzing and visualizing ridesharing data with Python.
## Resources 
- Software: 
  - Python 3.7.6
  - Jupyter Notebook
  
- Data Source(s):
  - city_data.csv
  - ride_data.csv

## Overview 
The purpose of this project is to perform exploratory analysis of Pyber ride sharing data in order to gain an understanding of ridership and fare metrics by the types of cities in which Pyber operates. I created visualizations of rideshare data for PyBer to help improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability.


## Results 
Through analysis and aggregation of PyBer ride sharing data, I have created a statistical overview and summary below:

By reviewing the summary we can see that there are several key findings including:

## Summary

Based on the analysis my business recommendations to Pyber are: 

1. Determine the perfect ratio of drivers-to-rides in each area that provides a liveable wage to each contracter. It is clear, for instance, that Urban areas are over saturated with drivers bringing down the average fare price. 
2. Increase the number of drivers in Rural areas to help bring down the high ride-to-driver ratio.
